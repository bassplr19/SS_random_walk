# SS_random_walk
Taking your SS data (collection dates and monthly check) it runs many iterations to see when you should start collecting SS

See how much your SS will return depending on when you collect assuming you invest it all and it compounds (or equivalently, not taking out of your existing investments)

It looks at the S&P 500 annual returns and assumes that your investments will return the same as a random year.
